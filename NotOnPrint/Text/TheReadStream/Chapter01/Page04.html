    <div  class="c9">
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sim has heard stories about an old wanderer wearing this helmet, but when the Stranger grabbed the glass by their chin and pulled out the vertical glass, the masked stranger revealed to have a rather young looking face. They slid the end of the hove at their mouth and started inhaling the steam. Tria-Dust is said to develop its effects rather quickly and rather strongly on the user, distorting their sense of reality and making them basically unconscious, but the stranger was inhaling it rather casually. Are the stories true? If this is the Old Wanderer Sim has heard stories about, then they have actually lived through the Bloodrains and are older than the Church of Order itself. Sim quickly finished her Des: &ldquo;I think I have to head back inside.&rdquo; They nodded: &ldquo;See you later.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Inside, her headache seemed to fade once more. Mel walked towards her. &ldquo;You could have warned me about the church paying us a visit&rdquo;. &ldquo;Yeah, sorry&hellip;&rdquo; Mel looked closer at her face: &ldquo;You are not looking good right now&hellip; is something wrong?&rdquo; &ldquo;Just some headache.&rdquo; Mel looked concerned. &ldquo;Maybe you should rest a little more, my guests don't need you to entertain them all the time.&rdquo; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s fine&rdquo; &ldquo;No, it's not, you are sleeping bad for days, let me serve you up some pepps and see how you feel after.&rdquo; Sim nods: &ldquo;Fine, &hellip; but there is one more thing I should tell you.&rdquo; &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; &ldquo;The fourth guest of those, they kinda look - this may be stupid, but they are kinda looking like the Old Wanderer&rdquo;. Mel&rsquo;s face froze: &ldquo;The Old Wanderer? Are you sure?&rdquo; Sim nods. Mel says: &ldquo;Okay, sit down at first, I'll make you some pepps and then I take a look outside and see what is up with this stranger.&rdquo; Sim nodded, then she looked for a table. &ldquo;Hey Sim!&rdquo; She turned around, Mel forced a smile on her frozen face: &ldquo;Thank you for telling me&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This time Mel did put on her fur coat. The stranger just stood there, looking at the Red Road, inhaling Tria-Dust. Sim was right. This was definitely a guest Mel did not expect to ever see again &ldquo;Alex?&rdquo; The Old Wanderer turned around. &ldquo;Hi Mel.&rdquo; From what Mel could see of her face, Alex really has not aged a single tide in ever since Mel and her last saw each other.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;So&hellip; What brings you to my inn after I have already grown old&rdquo; Mel asks. &ldquo;Just passing through. You surely have heard the rumours about this rouge puppet not so far from here. This Tex guy was sent by the church to hunt it down. I'll try to give him a hand.&rdquo; Alex takes another hit from the Tria. &ldquo;You are working for the Church now?&rdquo; &ldquo;Our interests just happen to align here&rdquo; Mel wants to keep pushing Alex on that. She does not understand why someone like her would want to work for the church again, but also she has closed this chapter of her life. Opening it again just couldn't be worth it.</span></p>
