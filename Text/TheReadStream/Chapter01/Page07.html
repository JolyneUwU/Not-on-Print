    <div  class="c9">
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mel does not know what it exactly is that Alex would want from Sim, but Sim is obviously the kind of person Alex would be interested in. And one thing is sure when Alex takes an interest in you, that means suffering. That means fighting. And that means, the world has a twisted Fate for you in store.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Suddenly Sim got up. She tried to stay calm, but Mel could see how upset she was, as she quickly got to the back door.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;What happened?&rdquo; Sim sat in her room, rolling another des cigarette as Mel walked in. &ldquo;This masked weirdo - You knew it?&rdquo; Mel sat down on the bed next to Sim. &ldquo;We were friends a long time ago. Alex and I fought together in the coastal civilities.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sim looked up, her eyes were glassy. &ldquo;You fought in war?&rdquo; Mel grins: &ldquo;I was trying my best at least. When a church of order guy wants to tell me how to live my life, I think that&rsquo;s worth rebelling against.&rdquo;&nbsp; Sim nods: &ldquo;And this masked one&hellip;&rdquo; &ldquo;&hellip;Alex&hellip;&rdquo; &ldquo;Yeah right Alex, she also fought?&rdquo; &ldquo;Well if you think I am skeptical of the gods, then you should talk to Alex about them.&rdquo; &ldquo;But didn&rsquo;t she come with the church of order?&rdquo; &ldquo;To Alex there is always a bigger fish to fry&hellip;&rdquo; But Mel had to know: &ldquo;What did she want from you?&rdquo; &ldquo;She asked me all those weird questions, like if I was hiding something from her&hellip; and it feels like she is the reason for my headache."&nbsp; Mel put an arm on Sim&rsquo;s back, giving her gentle rubs. &ldquo;She can be really scary sometimes. - You know what, take yourself a long break and I will talk again to Alex to see what&rsquo;s up.&rdquo; Sim nods.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Mel came back in front, Alex was nowhere to be seen. The others were all asking for keys to their room, so Alex had to wait.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sim was lying on her back blowing smoke in the air, when her headache got worse again. What the hell was going on. It feels like the sky is slowly coming down crushing the world Sim knew, her vision turned red, she needs to catch some air. Stumbling outside, through the exit in the back of the Inn, constantly losing balance, then vomiting, then a voice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Heyheyhey, calm down, I don&rsquo;t want to harm you&rdquo;</span></p>
