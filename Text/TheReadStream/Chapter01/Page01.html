        <p><strong><em>Chapter 1: Tavern Talks</em></strong></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was a cold noon, the 13</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> th</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> under Lucia and Fei. High Tide, the sky was bright, Mels Inn was dark, dark as usual.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sim sang her little blues. Mel liked Sim, she liked her voice. It justified the sadness of Sim&rsquo;s Songs. Not everybody agrees, but whoever's travelling down south the red road doesn&rsquo;t come and go to Mel&rsquo;s for the music.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;</span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lone in grief I go, doin&rsquo; what I know, singing till I blow, my man in grey is all I know&hellip;</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And so Mel cleaned a few tables. At noon, there is not a lot of traffic on the Red Road anyways. Two Strangers sat close by the door eating. And the usual fellas, from the Crimson-Belt came up here for gambling and drinking, business as usual.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Hey Mel, another round please&rdquo;. They were nice and paid reliable. &ldquo;Sure thing boys&rdquo;. Mel liked them. She went behind the bar. A pot of greens is cooking there constantly, mixed with pepper-sirup, poured in cups and voila: &ldquo;A fresh round of pepps! Here we go!&rdquo; &ldquo;Thanks Mel. It smells delicouse&rdquo;. She smiles: &ldquo;It really does, right?</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anything else I can do for you?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course not. After all that&rsquo;s&nbsp; why she liked them so much.</span></p>
        <p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;&hellip; And if this road doesn&rsquo;t take me to the promised land,</span></em></p>
        <p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">I&rsquo;ll keep on walking till I see the end.&rdquo;</span></em></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finishing her tune, Sim put down her salv, letting Mel overhear some of the strangers' dialogue. They were discussing whether or not to head West into the Deep-Womb. Mel consciously tried to not listen in on strangers&rsquo; conversations so she quickly walked to Sim after hearing something about the puppet of Madness. Shivers. Mel never liked the talks about the gods &ndash; sad Memories.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Sim, wonderful as usual.&rdquo; The singer was focused on her bag, still she countered: &ldquo;I messed up like 5 times&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Ohh, still trouble sleeping?&rdquo; She nods, pulling the meds out her bag Sim Adds: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what it is, but this eerie restlessness always grabs me past midnight,&rdquo; She puts the des-kraut on a piece of lavender paper, rolls it up into a cigarette and sticks it on the pipe. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m torn between smoking it away or using it to write&hellip; Whatever&hellip; wanna join me outside?&rdquo;</span></p>
