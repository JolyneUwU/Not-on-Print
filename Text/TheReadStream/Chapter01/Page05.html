<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Of course they do&hellip;&rdquo; Mel doesn't know what to say. On the one hand there are so many beautiful things that Alex remind her of, things that she wishes she could cherish with her. On the other hand Alex is just as closed off as usual and that after they haven't seen each other for half a life. She is pissed, but there would be nothing gained from expressing that to Alex right now.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Well it is nice to see you again, I'll check on my other guest for now.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;See ya&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That smell. The Old Wanderer knew that they had smelled, when that des smoking girl was standing next to them, might be an even bigger lead than that random puppet that has gone rogue in the woods. They definitely have to talk to her later. That smell can not possibly be a coincidence.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;&ldquo;Tex wants you inside, we have to plan for tomorrow.&rdquo; It was one of the twins, the wanderer did not bother to differentiate those two yet. &ldquo;Alright.&rdquo; They quickly inhale the&nbsp; rest of their steam and then follow the twin back inside. The Inn was small and cozy, exactly like the Wanderer would have expected Mel&rsquo;s Inn to look like. To the wanderer the stench of death was all over the place. Tex and the other twin were sitting by a window to the south side. &ldquo;So what plans do you wish to discuss?&rdquo; Tax leaned back: &ldquo;I think it is best if we get going early, when the tide just began to rise.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Sure thing.&rdquo; &ldquo;We should go to bed early and ask for a wake up call at low tight or whenever they go to bed. We might have a longer march through difficult terrain ahead of us, so I think except for rations and weapons we should carry as little as possible, as much as necessary.&rdquo; The old wanderer wrinkles their forehead. &ldquo;Is that what you called me inside for?&rdquo; Tex looks puzzled: &ldquo;Yes this is our plan for this tide and tomorrow, we want to&hellip;.&rdquo; They don&rsquo;t have time for this: &ldquo;Awesome, see you tomorrow.&rdquo; The wanderer gets up and takes a look around. They help themselves to a glass of pepps at the bar. Mel is currently at another table, collecting the check off a bunch of drunken midwits. The girl from earlier was sitting at a table, alone and slurping on some pepps.</span></p>
