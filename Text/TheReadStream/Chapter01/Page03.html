    <div  class="c9">
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Sim stood there, smoking her Des, thinking about the Night, she saw a white boat sailing down the Red Road. New guests for the Tavern? Probably. The Hull was high, two floors, there where outriggers on both sides of the boat, stabilising its ride down the Red Road. The cabin wasn't painted, showing the red wood, it was made from ginger oak.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This painted an indistinguishable picture, making it clear from a far that this boat was sailing under the Church of Order. Then she slowly started to feel a little pain in the back of her neck. Like a needle gently pressing against the upper end of her spine. It must be punishment for her insomnia. She took another hit from her Des and it faded.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sim was watching as the boat quickly swam closer towards the Inn. The weird headache seemed to crawl back into her neck, she ignored it. The Church of Order to her was a strange Bunch. They were fighting their holy wars against the heathens of Order bringing stability across the Red Road, but Sim has never quite understood what kind of order it was, that they were fighting for. She could recognise three people standing on deck, two of them were wearing brown robes, not a colour associated with the Church, the last one appeared to be a Priest, dressed in a dark red robe.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sim contemplated giving Mel a heads up, but decided to wait for them and finish her des in the meantime.&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With a &ldquo;Good Tide&rdquo; from the priest the three got off board. &ldquo;Welcome to Mel&rsquo;s Inn, what are you looking for?&rdquo; The priest seemed to be pretty young, maybe not even off age. The other two, probably mercenaries, were older, with long dark hair, they both looked like a copy from one another. &ldquo;My name is Tex, priest scholar of the Church of Order. Those two are Niff and Naff.&rdquo; A fourth Traveller exits the Cabin. Entirely hooded in brown with red iron boots and gauntlets. The face under the hood was also covered under the same metal. It must be the metal commonly referred to as Crimson. The needle pushed deeper into her head, she keeps numbing it with the des.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tex continues speaking: &ldquo;We plan on heading into the Womb from here, do you offer food and shelter maybe, so we can sit out the next low tide before?&rdquo; &ldquo;Normally we do, but you would have to check in with Mel first. She is in charge here.&rdquo; Tex noded, thanked Sim and headed inside, the Twins were following. The last Stranger kept standing outside, she pushed parts of their robe aside. They were wearing full Crimson armor. Sim&rsquo;s attention wandered to the belt, two small tanks were hanging there, one filled with powder the other with water. Attached to the second one was a short hose. Sim knew exactly what it was: Tria-Dust, a medicine prohibited by the Church of Order for most usage. &ldquo;Do you mind me steaming?&rdquo; they asked. Sim shook her head, still struggling with the pain and the Stranger opened the tanks, they put a teaspoon of the powder into the water and closed it, before the water started to boil. On the mask, or probably helmetet, there was a T in between the metal, black shaded glass covering their eyes, nose and mouth down to the chin. </span></p>
