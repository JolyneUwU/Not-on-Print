    <div  class="c9">
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This painted an indistinguishable picture, making it clear from a far that this boat was sailing for the Church of Order. The one Institution holding some sort of power at the entire East coast of Trestion. Sim knows that Mel wasn&rsquo;t exactly fond of them, but the Church also is not a power you openly despise these days. They bring something like stability and wealth to the states that they are present in, so in Sim&rsquo;s opinion they are far from the worst kind one could encounter these days.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then Sim slowly started to feel a little pain in the back of her neck. Like a needle gently pressing against the upper end of her spine. It must be punishment for her insomnia. She took another hit from her Des and it faded. She kept watching as the boat quickly swam closer towards the Inn. The weird headache seemed to crawl back into her neck, she ignored it. The longer she was looking at it, the more she thought about how despite everything the Church of Order still was a strange bunch. They were fighting their holy wars against the heathens of Order bringing stability across the Red Road, but this war itself never really seems to progress in any direction and just sturs up chaos here and there.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Soon she could recognise three people standing on deck, two of them were wearing brown robes, not a colour associated with the Church, the last one appeared to be a Priest, dressed in a dark red robe. Sim contemplated giving Mel a heads up, but decided to wait for them and finish her des in the meantime.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With a &ldquo;Good Tide&rdquo; from the priest the three got off board. &ldquo;Welcome to Mel&rsquo;s Inn, what are you looking for?&rdquo; The priest seemed to be pretty young, maybe not even off age. The other two, probably mercenaries, were older, with long dark hair, they both looked like a copy from one another. &ldquo;My name is Tex, priest scholar of the Church of Order. Those two are Niff and Naff.&rdquo; A fourth Traveller exits the Cabin. Entirely hooded in brown with red iron boots and gauntlets. The face under the hood was also covered under the same metal. It must be the metal commonly referred to as Crimson. The needle pushed deeper into her head, she kept numbing it with the des.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tex continued speaking: &ldquo;We plan on heading into the Womb from here, do you offer food and shelter maybe, so we can sit out the next low tide before?&rdquo; &ldquo;Normally we do, but you would have to check in with Mel first. She is in charge here.&rdquo; Tex nodded, thanked Sim and headed inside, the Twins were following. The last stranger kept standing outside, they pushed parts of their robe aside, revealing their full crimson armor. Sim&rsquo;s attention wandered to the belt, two small tanks were hanging there, one filled with powder the other with water. Attached to the second one was a short hose. Sim knew exactly what it was: Tria-Dust, a medicine prohibited by the Church of Order for most usage, said to cause strong psychedelic and emotional effects on it&rsquo;s user. &ldquo;Do you mind me steaming?&rdquo; they asked. Sim shook her head, still struggling with the pain and the Stranger opened the tanks, they put a teaspoon of the powder into the water and closed it, before the water started to boil. On the mask, or probably helmet, there was a T in between the metal, black shaded glass covering their eyes, nose and mouth down to the chin.</span></p>
