    <div  class="c9">
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She gets up and heads for the door. Mel follows her, looking to the boys. They seem to be doing fine. Looking to the strangers: &ldquo;In case you need anything, I&rsquo;m just outside the door for a minute.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Wind&nbsp; hits Mel hard, it&rsquo;s icy. Bright and icy. Mel should have brought a jacket. Sim on the other hand doesn&rsquo;t seem to mind. She has already lit up her des. Deep earthly smoke with a slight breeze of lavender surrounds her, the grey thin cotton robe shouldn&rsquo;t help Sim much. Mel would love to blame it on age or origin, all factors that could explain Sim&rsquo;s resistance towards the cold. Mel didn&rsquo;t like it, but she understands how it helps Sim. &ldquo;You know, Sim, when you can&rsquo;t sleep, you can always wake me up.&rdquo; &ldquo;Nuhhh dear, you need your sleep more than me, depside, I figured out: I can really use that restlessness for creativity.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mel put her hands on her own shoulders trying to rub a little heat into her body. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re writing again?&rdquo; Sim laid her hand on Mel&rsquo;s back, trying to help her warm up, but it was ice cold. &ldquo;A little,&rdquo; and after another pull from her des, she adds: &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll see where it goes, but it feels good to gather something new.&rdquo; &ldquo;Well as soon as you feel ready to present it&hellip;&rdquo; Sim nods. &ldquo;I know &hellip; and I appreciate it.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mel sighs. The wind still cut deeply into her skin. The guests might want another round. &ldquo;I guess, I should head back insight again&rdquo;. Sim nods: &ldquo;Sure thing. I&rsquo;ll just finish my cigarette, see ya.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sim just stands there dragging on her cigarette. Enjoying solitude. When Sim smokes she likes to take her time. Looking down the red road. Do nothing else. Think nothing else. Enjoying Solitude.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mel picked a beautiful place for her Inn. The wooden shack was set halfway down to the northern side of the Bleeding Mountains. Just a short walk away from the red road, dividing the free state of&nbsp; Madria from The Womb Woods. Sim looked up to the sky. Lucia and Fei, the latest twin Stars counted, where already deep west. There must have been like 20 Tides since they first appeared on the horizon. It must be evening by now. Sim sighs. You better enjoy the last high Tides of an evening, nobody knows how long the night lasts until the next star is counted.&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sim hates the nights: getting up, falling asleep it all feels pointless to her, when her world is dipped in darkness. She always fears, that the darkness might never end, that the last star has just been counted. Often it just takes a copple of Tides to proof her wrong, but still the fear is always there when the darkness comes. </span></p>
