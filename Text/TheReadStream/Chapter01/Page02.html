    <div  class="c9">
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The wind&nbsp; hit Mel hard, it&rsquo;s icy. Bright and icy. Mel should have brought a jacket. Sim on the other hand did not seem to mind at all. She had already lit up her des. Deep earthly smoke with a slight breeze of lavender surrounded her, the grey thin cotton robe shouldn&rsquo;t help Sim much. Mel would love to blame it on age or origin, all factors that could explain Sim&rsquo;s resistance towards the cold. Mel didn&rsquo;t like it, but she understood how it helped Sim to keep her peace. &ldquo;You know, Sim, when you can&rsquo;t sleep, you can always wake me up.&rdquo; &ldquo;No dear, you need your sleep more than me. And anyways, I figured out: I can really use that restlessness for creativity.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mel put her hands on her own shoulders trying to rub a little heat into her body. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re writing again?&rdquo; Sim laid her hand on Mel&rsquo;s back, trying to help her warm up. It was ice cold. &ldquo;A little,&rdquo; and after another pull from her des, she added: &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll see where it goes, but it feels good to gather something new again.&rdquo; &ldquo;Well as soon as you feel ready to present it&hellip;&rdquo; Sim nodded. &ldquo;I know &hellip; and I appreciate it.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mel sighs. The wind still cut deeply into her skin. The guests might want another round. &ldquo;I guess, I should head back inside again&rdquo;. Sim: &ldquo;Sure thing. I&rsquo;ll just finish my cigarette, see ya.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sim just stood there - dragging on her cigarette. Enjoying solitude. When Sim smokes she likes to take her time. Looking down the red road. Doing nothing else. Thinking nothing else. Enjoying solitude.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mel had picked a beautiful place for her Inn. The wooden shack was set halfway down to the northern side of the Bleeding Mountains. Just a short walk away from the red road, dividing the free state of&nbsp; Madria from the woods of the Womb. Sim looked up at the sky. Lucia and Fei -the latest stars counted- were already deep west. There must have been like 20 Tides since they first appeared on the horizon. It must be evening by now. Sim sighs. You better enjoy the last tides of an evening, nobody knows how long a night lasts until the next star is counted.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sim hates the nights: getting up, falling asleep, it all feels pointless to her, when her world is dipped in darkness. She always fears that the darkness might never end, that the last star has just been counted. Often it just takes a couple of Tides to prove her wrong, but still the fear is always there when the darkness comes.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Sim stood there, smoking her Des, thinking about the next night, a white boat was sailing down the Red Road. New guests for the Tavern? Probably. It was a big and sturdy boat. The Hull was high, two floors, there were outriggers on both sides of the boat, stabilising its ride down the Red Road. The cabin wasn't painted, showing the red wood, it was made from ginger oak. There were hanging chains from the side of the cabin and the Deck in front of the cabin was long and Spacey, behind it&rsquo;s high walls.</span></p>
