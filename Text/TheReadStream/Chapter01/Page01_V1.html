        <p class="c4">Chapter 1: Tavern Talks</p>
        <p>It was a cold noon, the 13<sup> th Tide</sup> under Lucia and Fei. High Tide, the sky was bright, Mels Inn was dark, dark as usual.</p>
        <p>Sim sang her little blues. Mel liked Sim, she liked her voice. It justified the sadness of Sim&rsquo;s Songs. Not everybody agrees, but whoever's travelling down south the red road doesn&rsquo;t come and go to Mel&rsquo;s for the music.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;<em>Lone in grief I go, doin&rsquo; what I know, singing till I blow, my man in grey is all I know&hellip;</em>&rdquo;</p>
        <p>And so Mel cleaned a few tables. At noon, there is not a lot of traffic on the Red Road anyways. Two Strangers sat close by the door eating. And the usual fellas, from the Crimson-Belt came up here for gambling and drinking as usual.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Hey Mel, another round please&rdquo;. They were nice and paid reliable. &ldquo;Sure thing boys&rdquo;. Mel liked them. She went behind the bar. A pot of greens is cooking there constantly, mixed with pepper-sirup, poured in cups and voila: &ldquo;A fresh round of pepps! Here we go!&rdquo; &ldquo;Thanks Mel. It smells delicouse&rdquo;. She smiles: &ldquo;It really does, right?</p>
        <p>Anyways, anything else I can do?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>Of course not. After all that&rsquo;s&nbsp; why she liked them so much.</p>
        <p><em>&ldquo;&hellip; And if this road doesn&rsquo;t take me to the promised land,</em></p>
        <p><em>I&rsquo;ll keep on walking till I see the end.&rdquo;</em></p>
        <p>Finishing her tune, Sim put down her salv, letting Mel overhear some of the strangers' dialogue. They were discussing whether or not to head West into the Deep-Womb. Mel consciously tried to not listen in on strangers&rsquo; conversations so she quickly walked to Sim after hearing something about the puppet of Madness. Shivers. Mel never liked the talks about the gods &ndash; sad Memories.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Sim, wonderful as usual.&rdquo; The singer was focused on her bag, still she countered: &ldquo;I messed up like 5 times&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Ohh, still trouble sleeping?&rdquo; She nods, pulling the meds out her bag Sim Adds: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what it is, but this eerie restlessness always grabs me past midnight,&rdquo; She puts the des-kraut on a piece of Lavendel Paper, rolls it up into a cigarette and sticks it on the pipe. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m torn between smoking it away or using it to write. Anyway, wanna join me outside?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>She gets up and heads for the door. Mel follows her, looking to her boys. They seem fine. Looking to the strangers: &ldquo;In case you need anything, I&rsquo;m just outside the door for a minute.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The Wind&nbsp; hits Mel hard, it&rsquo;s icy. Bright and icy. Mel should have brought a jacket. Sim on the other hand doesn&rsquo;t seem to mind. She has already lit up her Des. Deep earthly smoke with a slight breeze of lavender surrounds her, the grey thin cotton robe shouldn&rsquo;t help Sim much. Mel would love to blame it on age or origin, all factors that could explain Sim&rsquo;s resistance towards the cold. Mel didn&rsquo;t like it, but she understands how it helps Sim. &ldquo;You know, Sim, when you can&rsquo;t sleep, you can always wake me up.&rdquo; &ldquo;Nuhhh dear, you need your sleep more than me, depside, I figured out; I can really use that restlessness for creativity.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>Mel put her hands on her own shoulders trying to rub a little heat into her body. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re writing again?&rdquo; Sim laid her hand on Mel&rsquo;s back, trying to help her warm up, but it was ice cold. &ldquo;A little,&rdquo; and after another pull from her des, she adds: &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll see where it goes, but it feels good to gather something new.&rdquo; &ldquo;Well as soon as you feel ready to present it&hellip;&rdquo; Sim nods. &ldquo;I know &hellip; and I appreciate it.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>Mel sights. The wind still cut deeply into her skin. The guests might want another round. &ldquo;I guess, I should head back insight again&rdquo;. Sim nods: &ldquo;Sure thing. I&rsquo;ll just finish my cigarette, see ya.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Sim just stands there dragging on her cigarette. Enjoying solitude. When Sim smokes she likes to take her time. Look down the red road. Do nothing else. Think nothing else. Enjoying Solitude.</p>
        <p>Mel picked a beautiful place for her Inn. The wooden shack was set halfway down to the northern side of the Bleeding Mountains. Just a short walk away from the red road, dividing the free state of&nbsp; Madria from The Womb Woods. Sim looked up to the Sky. Lucia and Fei, the latest twin Stars counted, where already deep west. There must have been like 20 Tides since they first appeared on the horizon. It must be evening by now. Sim sighs. You better enjoy the last high Tides of an evening, nobody knows how long it takes till the next star is counted.</p>
