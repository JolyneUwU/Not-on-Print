    <div  class="c9">
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sim has heard stories about an old wanderer wearing this helmet, but when the Stranger grabbed the glass by their chin and pulled out the vertical glass, the Old Wanderer revealed to have a rather young looking face. They slid the end of the hove at their mouth and started inhaling the steam. Are the stories true? If this is the Old Wanderer Sim has heard stories about, then they have actually lived through the bloodrains and are older then the Church of Order. Sim quickly finished her Des: &ldquo;I think I have to head back inside.&rdquo; They nodded: &ldquo;See you later.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Inside, her headache seemed to fade once more. Mel walked towards her. &ldquo;You could have warned me about the church paying us a visit&rdquo;. &ldquo;Yeah, sorry&hellip;&rdquo; Mel looked closer at her face: &ldquo;You are not looking good right now&hellip; is something wrong?&rdquo; &ldquo;Just some headache.&rdquo; Mel looked concerned. &ldquo;Maybe you should rest a little more, my guest don't need you to entertain them all the time.&rdquo; &ldquo;No, it's not, you are sleeping bad for days, let me serve you up some pepps and see how you feel after.&rdquo; Sim nods: &ldquo;Fine, &hellip; but there is one more thing I should tell you.&rdquo; &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; &ldquo;The fourth guest of those, they kinda look - this mind be stupid, but they are kinda looking like the Old Wanderer&rdquo;. Mel&rsquo;s face froze: &ldquo;The Old Wanderer? Are you sure?&rdquo; Sim nods. Mel says: &ldquo;Okay, sit down at first, I'll make you some pepps and then I take a look outside and see what is up with this stranger.&rdquo; Sim noded, then she looked for a table. &ldquo;Hey Sim!&rdquo; She turned around, Mel forced a smile on her frozen face: &ldquo;Thank you for telling me&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This time Mel did put on her fur coat. The stranger just stood there, looking at the Red Road, inhaling Tria-Dust. Sim was right, this was definitely a guest Mel did not expect seeing ever again &ldquo;Alex?&rdquo; The Old Wanderer turned around. &ldquo;Hi Mel.&rdquo; From what Mel could see of her face, Alex really has not aged a day in the decades Mel and her haven't seen each other.&nbsp;</span></p>
