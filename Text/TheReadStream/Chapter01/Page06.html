<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tex buries his face in his hands. He still is not sure whether it was the right choice to take this mercenary on such a mission. If he really is as good as they say, why would they have wanted Tex and the mercenaries to go with him. And if he is just a good mercenary why is he taking none of this seriously. This whole mission seems really off. He looks at Niff and Naff: &ldquo;Okay, so you two got the plan right? I think we should be getting as much rest as we can tomorrow, I have some doubts in regards to the capabilities and intentions of our 4th member so I want you to be prepared for anything, coming our way, when we look for this puppet in the woods&rdquo; The two strangers by the door door turned around for a short moment then they got back to mumbling. Niff nodded, Naff: &ldquo;You want us to also keep an eye on the Old Wanderer, while we hunt the Puppet?&rdquo; &ldquo;Well our goal is first and foremost to hunt down this puppet, I just wanted to share my concerns with you in regards to this mercenary&rsquo;s capabilities, when it comes to sticking to a plan. If my information is correct, he should be more than capable to take down this puppet with us, but we will have to see how everything goes next tide.&rdquo; Niff nodded again, Naff replied: &ldquo;Okay, that makes sense, let&rsquo;s just hope he makes things easier rather than more difficult.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Behind the mercenaries the two strangers who were making eyes earlier just got up and slendered towards the table where Tex and the Mercenaries were sitting. Tex looked up: &ldquo;Good Tide, I am Tex, priest scholar of the Church of Order. Those two are Niff and Naff. How can we help you?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Err, hello, I am Clayat and this is&nbsp; Wyaar. We come from the Red Harbour, we erm&hellip;&rdquo; Clayat, the tall, scrunkly one, gets interrupted by Wyaar, the small, sturdy one of the two: &ldquo;We are on a pilgrim trip to the Womb and we heard you guys talk about this Rouge Puppet&hellip;.&rdquo; Now Naff interrupted Wyaar: &ldquo;Look you two seem like very nice pilgrim fellas, but the womb really is a dangerous place, I think&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the other table the Old Wanderer was still talking to Sim. &ldquo;So you live here, sing and write some songs and that is basically your life.&rdquo; Sim nods,&nbsp; why is this masked weirdo asking her all those questions? It feels like Sim is being interrogated. Her heas hurts. &ldquo;What are your songs about?&rdquo; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, depends, they are mostly downers&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;What do you mean, like they are about grief?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mel just stood there, looking at Alex and Sim. The Crimson-Belt Minors just left. She looks at those two, not hearing but vaguely knowing what they are talking about. Sim is special, a little different. Plagued with those curses that run the read stream. Mel just wants her to have a normal life, an easy life. But Alex, she is the most special of them all. Whatever kind of god it is that has cursed her, it spits in the face of all the Gods known to Mother&rsquo;s children. Ever since Mel knew her, Alex was raging her own war against every god out there, first and foremost her own curse. Mel has always respected that, Alex had a peculiar drive, that makes Mel just wish that one day Alex will get the Freedom she is striving for. But also Alex is a force of nature, destructive to the ones around her and she has lost touch with humanity a long time ago. </span></p>
