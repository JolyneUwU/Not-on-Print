<p><span style="font-weight: 500;">Heyhey:)</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 500;">If you are reading this, then this means that </span><a href="http://www.notonprint.com"><span style="font-weight: 500;">www.notonprint.com</span></a><span style="font-weight: 500;"> is online. As of now it mostly is an unfinished project so I want to guide you a little through what we have so far:&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 500;">This right here is my </span><span style="font-weight: 500;">diary</span><span style="font-weight: 500;">. I upload here whenever I feel like it or when there are things happening, mostly about the website and the content, but maybe in my life as well, we&rsquo;ll see about that&hellip;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 500;">This is part of </span><span style="font-weight: 500;">the </span><span style="font-weight: 500;">text section, where I will upload most consistently. Aside from the </span><span style="font-weight: 500;">diary</span><span style="font-weight: 500;"> I do </span><span style="font-weight: 500;"><a href="/Text/Reviews.html">reviews</a>, <a href="/Text/Shortstories.html">short stories</a></span><span style="font-weight: 500;"> and a fantasy series called the </span><a href="/Text/TheReadStream.html"><span style="font-weight: 500;">Red Stream</span></a><span style="font-weight: 500;">.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 500;">The</span><a href="/cummingsoon.html"><span style="font-weight: 500;"> coming soon</span></a><span style="font-weight: 500;"> section currently is used</span><span style="font-weight: 500;"> to show what I want to have published before notonprint is in version 1.0. F</span><span style="font-weight: 500;">or the future I want to commit to a set timetable for regular uploads of reviews, short stories and chapters for The Red Stream, just give me some time to get used to the website first</span><span style="font-weight: 500;">:)</span></p>
<p><a href="/Audio.html"><span style="font-weight: 500;">Audio</span></a><span style="font-weight: 500;"> is also something where I currently have collaborative projects in the </span><span style="font-weight: 500;">working, let's</span><span style="font-weight: 500;"> see where this might go.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://notonprint.com/About.html"><span style="font-weight: 500;">About</span></a><span style="font-weight: 500;"> is the section where I would like to introduce everyone involved in&nbsp; </span><a href="http://www.notonprint.com"><span style="font-weight: 500;">www.notonprint.com</span></a><span style="font-weight: 500;">. Currently this is Jolyne (Jay)</span><span style="font-weight: 500;">, my dear girlfriend, who is in charge of developing the website and me</span><span style="font-weight: 500;">,</span><span style="font-weight: 500;"> writing text.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 500;">Then there is <a href="/index.html">homepage</a>, </span><span style="font-weight: 500;">also still work in progress(:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 500;">So yeah this </span><a href="http://www.notonprint.com"><span style="font-weight: 500;">www.notonprint.com</span></a><span style="font-weight: 500;"> feel free to explore and dive in. If you are interested in knowing a little more about the text I already have uploaded there is a short overview just below</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 500;">Until next time,</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So here is an overview of the</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> english writings currently on</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> notonprint:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><a href="/Text/TheReadStream.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Red Stream</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">: These are the first pages of chapter one of “the Red Stream - A Deal with Death”. Chapter one features a small inn, where a couple of characters come together. Meet The Old Wanderer, Sim and a bunch of other figures that will guide you deeper through the Red Stream, as this project goes on.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><a href="/Text/Reviews/HurryUpTomorrow.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Review - Hurry up Tomorrow</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">: As of now The Weeknd dropped his last album under this name. Able Tesafay’s most complex dissection of his own persona and why he has to let go of it. This album really impressed me. Why? Read at in the review section.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><a href="/Text/Reviews/Eusexa.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Review - Eusexa</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">:  FKA Twigs also dropped an awesome LP this year, give it a listen if you like alternative electronic pop or read my review on it:)</span></li>

<p><span id="Update" style="font-weight: 400;">+++Update+++</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">04.01.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hey again:)</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I took a longer break. Now that I finally got back to work we have some Updates, here we go:</span></p>
<p><br /><br /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">First things first, if everything goes according to plan, you now have the option to switch between an english and a german version of this website. Just click</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the button on the top right corner </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">and select your preferred language.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We also have a proper </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="/index.html">homepage</a> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">now</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aside from that we did some more small fixes with hyperlinks, spelling and stuff, but nothing huge.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is also some text on the page I have not talked about so far.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;<a href="/Text/Reviews/ZoneOfIntrest.html">The Zone of Interest</a>&rdquo; </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is a movie that I highly recommend, I also think in my review are some perspectives that could add to your perception of the film:)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;<a href="/Text/Shortstories/LetzteWorte.html">Letzte Worte</a>&rdquo;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and &ldquo;<a href="/Text/Shortstories/FlugInDieNacht.html">Flug in die Nacht</a>&rdquo; are the short stories I wrote in 2023 while applying for some writing universities. While I have changed a lot since then I still like how they reflected on my life at that time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"<a href="/Text/Reviews/Spiritfahrer.html">Spiritfarer</a>"</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is an indie game one could play via Netflix abo or buy - I really liked that too.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And for my review on </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;<a href="/Text/Reviews/TheApothecaryDiaries.html">Apothecary Diaries</a>&rdquo;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> I did something different: I mainly talked about the relationship between tone and setting, feel free to check that out as well:)</span></p>
<p><br /><br /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So where are we now? I had some plans and ideas, but life just got in the way. For now I plan to upload something new every Sunday and possibly finalize a longer term plan for notonprint that I surely will tell you about in the future</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">See you soon</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kassandra</span></p>

<br>
<p><span id="OneMonth" style="font-weight: 400;">+++ 1 month of weekly Uploads +++</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">01.02.2026</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I did it:)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After last year when I was taking a very long break because of the intense launch of the website, I am now very happy to report that the first month of 2026 I managed to keep a routine for the first month. The idea to have a set day on which I just upload whatever I have so far finished really seems to work for me. I wrote not daily but still regularly. Instead of just throwing ideas away when they get too big or I fail at executing them I now finish some small projects every week. That keeps me motivated. I consider maybe taking off a week from time to time if that helps me focus on bigger projects, but probably not in February.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anyways I want to share some thoughts on what I wrote so far. The Red Stream chapter one developed differently from what I had originally planned. But the idea of keeping it shorter and ending it on a cliffhanger opened better options for chapter two then what I initially planned so I am confident in that decision. Places is fun and works really well against writer's blockade. I hope there is something there for the readers. Everything else was mostly fun:)</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also I was informed that Google autotranslated text for some readers. I deactivated it. When I want text translated in my opinion it would be necessary for a human to translate otherwise, there is just no control over tone and other nuances.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That's it. Looking forward to the future of notonprint, currently I am sitting on a folder to apply for a university in creative writing again. I might as well post updates on that.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sincerely Kassandra &lt;3</span></p>
<p><br /><br /><br /></p>


<p><span id="ApplicationFolder" style="font-weight: 400;">+++Application Folder Leipzig+++</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">01.03.2026</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In my last Update I mentioned the folder for the university of Leipzig I was working on. I just sent it away this weekend. Most of the text I wrote last month was written for this application. Amongst those were two uploads I want to address, since they broke format a little.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Zone of Interest Review: So I already had a Review for The Zone of Interest, but I wanted to also have a review in my Folder for Leipzig and it would have to be German. Since I have a lot to say about this movie and since I have developed some new ideas, I wrote a new review in German.</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was different, but I liked doing a German review for once, there might be more to come in the future.</span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Marry Messer: Marry Messer was an idea that I had in the back of my head for longer. Since it would have to be a bigger project, I kept postponing it. But eventually I just started writing. It now is like The Red Stream, a bigger project, a serial. This time in german. This time a coming of age story. I am really excited about it.</span></li>
</ol>
<p><br /><br /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That's it for now.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">sincerely</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kassandra</span></p>
