<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Live is normal, nothing weird ever happens</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cara does not care. She is the type of girl that does not have an opinion on the milk-cereal dilemma. Most of the time she rawdogs them cereals anyanyways. That or her breakfast is just an espresso. Yeah, she is just chill like that. The one time she forgot to buy new shampoo she just used hand sanitizer for like a week and when there is nothing else at home she even is perfectly fine with cereals for dinner or soup for breakfast.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cara really does not care whether her wifi works or whether she has to use mobile data. When she forgets to charge her phone, she is completely fine leaving the house with just 19% of the battery left. When she takes the bus and the person next to her obviously has the sniffles, she just really doesn't care.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Okay that is what you have to know going into that story:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cara is sitting at her office desk. She is an intern at Corpo Inc. Working there would be her dream job. Currently she is doing the excel sheet stuff that you have to do at Corpo Inc: comparing customer data, going over the weekly reviews, calculating the risk-benefit factors&hellip;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When her Boss comes up to her. John Ceo, an impressive man doing impressive work both representing and communicating for Corpo Inc.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">John Ceo: How is your excel shiyt stuff going?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cara: Ughhhh! It's called: &ldquo;How is your excel sheet stuff going?&rdquo; That's disgusting, why would you say something that is so linguistically offensive.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That's it! I can't do it! My view on this company is totally crushed now! I can't work in such an environment anymore.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She flips over the table and walks out. John Ceo's eyes follow her, till she slams the door.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">John Ceo: Anyways, back to work everywoon.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What an odd moment, right? I thought Cara couldn't care less, but she did genuinely appear to care about linguistics.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anyways, gotta get back to work now, John Ceo is already looking weird at me.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Talk to you later.</span></p>
<p><br /><br /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Margaret Therapy has been staring at the screen for a full hour. Why would her client send this to her? What were they trying to tell her? She is just an accountant, does this have anything to do with accounting?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A second message pops up on her screen:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whoops wrong number. I was supposed to send this to my therapist!</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She nods. Now everything makes sense. Everything is normal again. Nothing weird has actually happened. She smiles and gets back to watering her printer.&nbsp;</span></p>
