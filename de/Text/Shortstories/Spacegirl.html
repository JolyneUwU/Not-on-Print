        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*Space girl*</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;What would you do if I were to go to space?&rdquo; She asked. &ldquo;Like becoming an Astronaut?&rdquo; She nods. &ldquo;I don't know, go for it I guess, the training will be hard though.&rdquo; &ldquo;Would you miss me?&rdquo; &ldquo;Probably, I guess we could figure this all out while you go through the training, it&rsquo;d be a long process, you know that, right?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She shakes her head. &ldquo;That's not what I meant.&rdquo; Sam looks confused. &ldquo;What did you mean?&rdquo; The girl repeats herself: &ldquo;Would you miss me if I were to go to space?&rdquo; Sam shrugs: &ldquo;probably yeah, but I want to support your dreams.&rdquo; Liv: &ldquo;What if it wasn't my dream? Like I&rsquo;d get abducted by aliens tomorrow.&rdquo; &ldquo;That would suck. I want you to live your best live and also yes I love spending time with you, I don't think that would be possible after you got abducted by aliens.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Liv's eyes turn big: &ldquo;really?&rdquo; Sam shrugs: &ldquo; I don't know about the alien part, but I do love spending time with you and if going to space means I can't do that anymore, then yes: I would really miss you.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Liv smiles.</span></p>
        <p><br /><br /></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Later that evening Liv and Sam are hanging around by the lake. It is summer, the sky still shines bright and weather still allows for skimpy clothes. They are chilling on a blanket. Val, Miranda and Peacock are there as well. Snacking foods, listening to trance, just another Tuesday evening.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Liv is thinking about spaceships again. Someday she wants to build her own rocket and fly into space. Just floating around the void. Quietly. Peacefully. Counting stars.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Liv? Hey Liv, are you still with us?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Sorry, I was just a little daydreaming&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Val is free tomorrow. So she suggests going to a bar. Miranda and Peacock decide to skip their classes tomorrow. Sam has to go home, they can not skip work casually. &ldquo;But feel free to join the others if you want to, Liv.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Okay&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bars are always so noisy. Liv has a hard time following what the others are talking about. It's something about drama between Viccy and Peacock. Liv is mildly interested. She tries to participate, but it is so noisy, slowly she drifts back into space. She glides through a curtain of dust. Space dust. At some point she is too tired to glide. She sets the ship into autopilot and swims from the cockpit towards the cabin.&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sam has made herself ready to go to work. But has not already left, when Liv came back home. &ldquo;How was it?&rdquo; Liv yawns: &ldquo;It was nice, but I'm tired now.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At night the space girl is dreaming about her space life. Suddenly the void is not as empty anymore. There is a harbour now. Liv lands her ship. She shops for the necessary parts and resources, then she comes across a suspicious merchant with a secret task. Liv receives an egg to be delivered to a planet far far away.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;How did you sleep?&rdquo; Sam has already returned from work when Liv gets up. &ldquo;Good, how was work?&rdquo; Sam talks. Work seems really stressful.&nbsp; Liv wants to be there and listen, but also feels uneasy.&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After Sam goes to bed, Liv goes back into space. The Egg is stored in a big grey box under her bed in the cabin. She takes another look at the egg. It is brown, shiny, a bit like copper. But the shell is not smooth. It is wrinkly. Liv is scared to break it if she were to touch it, however it feels like there is heat radiating from the egg. It seems to have a pulse. Liv forgets about time.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;What did you do during my nap?&rdquo; Sam asks. &ldquo;Not much&hellip; just daydreaming ig.&rdquo; &ldquo;Sweet.&rdquo; And after a short break they add: &ldquo;I'll make myself some breakfast. You want something as well?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Sure&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Breakfast, then there is a doctor's appointment. Waiting in the waiting room. Liv is looking for the egg. It is gone. She wants to search the cabin but gets interrupted.&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Ms Graustein, please.&rdquo; The Doctor checks her pulse, then talks a bit with her, also there is blood to be taken, then she gets the recipe and heads back into space. She finds the Box open in the storage room, but no egg to be found, there is some grey crusty slime and some of her liquor is gone. She chooses to take care of this later and heads back to the cockpit.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At noon she and Val have a date at a caf&eacute;. Live heads there from the doctor's appointment.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To be continued..</span></p>
